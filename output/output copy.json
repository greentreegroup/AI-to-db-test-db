What a great way to spend \nmoney!\ndjs\n\n\nHere are some pictures from the first roll of film - Emily was about 5 or 6 \ndays old.  She brings me joy I never thought possible.  And I'm sure some day \nshe'll bring me some pain, but I'm not thinking about that right now.  I \ndidn't know how easy it was to fall in love.  I am a different person \n(better) because of her.  \nYesterday, we made our first trip to the pediatrician and he said that she \nwas doing fine.  She gained  7 ounces!  She's quite a good little eater.  We \nare settling into a routine and she sleeps about 4 hours at a time so it \ngives me time to get a fair amount of rest.  We'll probably make a trip down \nto the EB in a few weeks and I'll be sure to let you know exactly when.  I \nhope you all are doing well -- stay in touch.  Here's the pictures.....(by \nthe way, the blonde at the hospital with me is my youngest sister, Kerri)\n", "class": "Positive", "probability": 100, "Date": "2000-07-19 01:56:00", "From": "dianne.swiber@enron.com", "To": "sally.beck@enron.com", "Subject": "Emily's First Pictures"}, {"body": "Please check on those marked below\n\n\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Patti Thompson                           01/16/2001 11:13 AM\n\t\n\n", "class": "Neutral", "probability": 80, "Date": "2001-01-16 04:47:00", "From": "sally.beck@enron.com", "To": "patti.thompson@enron.com", "Subject": "Re: Possible dinner sites for OU students"}, {"body": "\nDue to a variety of circumstances we did not migrate employees to the UBSWE environment tonight (Monday, February 4, 2002).
