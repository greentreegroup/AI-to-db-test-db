This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we\nwere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom\nunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.\nPhillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.\nSincerely,\nGeorge W.

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

The \nWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \nwhich comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \nthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \ngeneration.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their \ngeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \nwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \nif they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \nschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \nall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \nthe generation side.\n\nOn the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \nthey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \nload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\n\nI think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \nothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas \ndemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \nespecially compared to all gas consumption.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \nan issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \nO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \nI'll take care of it..\n\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \n$235,019.   \n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \noverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \n#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\n  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\n  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\n  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\n  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\n  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\n Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \nGDP-Kingsgate.\n\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \nwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \nI'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the \ndetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \nappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be \nan operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar \nimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in \ncase there's something you want to do about it.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \ngain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \nCould you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \ntypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \nHow much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \ncontacts at SW Gas?\n\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird", "class": "Neutral", "probability": 60, "Date": "Thu, 27 Apr 2000 06:55:00 -0700 (PDT)", "From": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "To": "laird.dyer@enron.com", "Subject": "SW Gas"}, {"body": "Kay & Neal,\n\nThanks for remembering my birthday.
